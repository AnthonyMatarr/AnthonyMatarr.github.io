I am a data scientist and aspiring machine learning engineer excited by applying novel modeling methods in medicine and healthcare. I’m currently a first‑year Postbaccalaureate (Postbac) Research Fellow in the Intramural Research Training Award (IRTA) program at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), working with the Machine Learning Team (MLT), led by Dr. Francisco Pereira in the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). The alphabet soup of acronyms and short-hands has taken some getting used to for me too.

My Work
------
As part of my work with the Machine Learning Team, I work on applications of large language models in psychology and clinical research. Concurrently, and outside my day‑to‑day projects, I’ve developed several clinical classification models for surgical outcomes, including two that are deployed as interactive risk‑prediction tools. You can find details and links in my [Portfolio](/portfolio/).

Research Interests
------
I’m interested in developing and deploying machine learning methods that are both scientifically sound and clinically practical. My goal is to help bridge the gap between advanced predictive models and tools that clinicians can understand, trust, and use in everyday care. I’m also excited about contributing to methodological advances that move the field forward and lay the groundwork for future clinical applications.

Education Background
------
I graduated in May 2025 from the University of Virginia with a B.A. in Computer Science.

On a more personal note
------
When I’m not experimenting with models at my desk, I’m usually on a trail somewhere near D.C. My love for the mountains started during my time at UVA in Charlottesville and has only grown since. I enjoy playing chess and the piano in my free time as well (both still a work in progress). I’m also a certified pest control technician in the Commonwealth of Virginia, which taught me a lot about careful observation and working with stakeholders in real‑world settings. *Insert debug pun here.*
