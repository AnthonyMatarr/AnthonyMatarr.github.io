- Developed ML models to predict postoperative surgical and aspiration‑related complications, unplanned reoperation, and bleeding after glossectomy for tongue cancer.

- Used 8,266 patients from an original cohort of over 13 million in the 2008–2024 NSQIP dataset to create and validate risk strata.

- Led model design and evaluation using logistic regression, gradient‑boosted trees, neural networks, SVMs, and stacked ensembles.

- Built and deployed a web interface (PRO‑Tongue) for patient‑level risk assessment (https://pro-tongue.streamlit.app/).

- Manuscript currently under peer review.
