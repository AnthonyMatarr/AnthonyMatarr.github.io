- Developed ML-based risk stratification models for major medical/surgical complications, mortality, unplanned reoperation, and venous thrombosis after non‑cosmetic breast surgery

- Curated and cleaned > 13M entries to define an analytic cohort of 737,730 NSQIP patients (2008–2024) and derive/validate clinically usable risk groups

- Designed the modeling strategy (including logistic regression, gradient‑boosted trees, neural networks, and stacked ensembles) and defined a final risk‑binning scheme

- Built and deployed a web application ([PRO‑Breast](/portfolio/pro-breast)) for individual patient risk assessment

- Manuscript currently under peer review
